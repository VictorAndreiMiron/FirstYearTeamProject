<!-- Scenario -->
</br>
</br>
</br>
    <p2>You are cruising along the motorway, enjoying the sunset and cool breeze on your neck. At the end of the road is a roundabout, each leading to a different destination. Which path should you take...  </p2> <!-- if p2{ position:absolute; } text is centered but if text is too long it covers the hexagons -->
</br>
</br>
</br>

<!-- Options -->
<div class="hexagon hexColour1"><p3>A sturdy long bridge, stretching over the gushing river.</p3></div>
<div class="hexagon hexColour2"><p3>A road passing into a large oak forest; the winding trees are thick and twining, creating a dark green, slightly eerie canopy.</p3></div>
<div class="hexagon hexColour3"><p3>A road that passes into a vast desert - the hot sand gleams at the side of the road, the road stretches into the horizon with no signs of life anywhere near.</p3></div>
